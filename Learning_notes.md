### Binary point cloud packing
```bash
packed_rgb = struct.unpack('I', struct.pack('f', rgba))[0]
                    b = (packed_rgb >> 16) & 0xFF
                    g = (packed_rgb >> 8) & 0xFF
                    r = packed_rgb & 0xFF
```
This code extracts the individual red, green, and blue color values from a 32-bit float `rgba`, where `rgba` represents color data encoded in a specific format. Letâ€™s break down each step:

### Code Breakdown

1. **Packing the `rgba` Float to Binary**:
   ```python
   packed_rgb = struct.unpack('I', struct.pack('f', rgba))[0]
   ```
   - `struct.pack('f', rgba)`: This takes the 32-bit floating-point `rgba` value and packs it into a binary format (4 bytes) as if it were a `float`.
   - `struct.unpack('I', ...)`: It then interprets this binary data as a 32-bit unsigned integer (`'I'`), which allows for bitwise operations.
   - `packed_rgb` now contains the integer representation of the RGBA value in binary form.

2. **Extracting Blue, Green, and Red Components**:
   ```python
   b = (packed_rgb >> 16) & 0xFF
   g = (packed_rgb >> 8) & 0xFF
   r = packed_rgb & 0xFF
   ```
   - **`b = (packed_rgb >> 16) & 0xFF`**:
     - `packed_rgb >> 16` shifts the binary representation 16 bits to the right, moving the blue channel (stored in the 3rd byte) into the least significant byte position.
     - `& 0xFF` extracts just the last 8 bits (one byte), isolating the blue value.
   
   - **`g = (packed_rgb >> 8) & 0xFF`**:
     - `packed_rgb >> 8` shifts the binary representation 8 bits to the right, moving the green channel (stored in the 2nd byte) into the least significant byte position.
     - `& 0xFF` isolates the green value.
   
   - **`r = packed_rgb & 0xFF`**:
     - `& 0xFF` directly extracts the red channel, which is in the least significant byte position.

### Example
If `rgba` encoded as a float represents a color where `r = 100`, `g = 150`, and `b = 200`, then:
1. `packed_rgb` will be an integer with a binary layout like `0b00000000bbbbbbbbggggggggrrrrrrrr`.
2. `b`, `g`, and `r` will be extracted from this integer using bitwise operations.

### Purpose
This approach is used when color data is packed into a single floating-point value, which might happen in certain graphics formats or APIs. The code interprets this float as raw binary to decode the separate red, green, and blue values.
